# End of an Era

DevExpress has finally added the feature [we've all been waiting for](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/S133081/summary-provide-the-capability-to-define-expressions-for-the-summaries) in 17.2! An expression binding is much more usable than the SummaryFieldâ€“ a single expression can do the job that it used to take multiple SummaryFields and a final CalculatedField to achieve.

Much as I've enjoyed writing this hack, nothing is more delightful than native support. I'm a bit disappointed that I never shared SummaryField v2 with new abilities, such as datasource-level PartitionBy on any band, or working inside aggregated expressions. Sadly, I have little time to spare. But kudos to DevExpress for doing the right thing and providing a first-class experience! That was the goal I was hoping for when I went public with this project. Perhaps it made a difference. ðŸŽ‰
